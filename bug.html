```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">

</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature.  However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too different, it might result in unexpected banding or color transitions, especially on older browsers or devices with less powerful graphics capabilities.  This isn't a bug in Tailwind itself, but rather a limitation of how gradients are rendered.
