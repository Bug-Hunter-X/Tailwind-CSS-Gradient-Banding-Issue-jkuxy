This improved version uses the `via` property to add an intermediate color. This helps smooth the transition between `from` and `to` colors, reducing the banding effect.  You may need to experiment with different intermediate colors or more color stops to achieve the desired result.  Consider using colors that are closer in hue or saturation for smoother gradients.
