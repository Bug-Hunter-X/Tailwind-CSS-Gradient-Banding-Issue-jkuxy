# Tailwind CSS Gradient Banding Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to color gradients in Tailwind CSS.  It highlights how significant differences in gradient `from` and `to` colors can sometimes lead to banding or uneven transitions in the rendered output.  The issue isn't a bug in Tailwind itself but rather a limitation of gradient rendering in certain browser environments or on less performant devices. 

The `bug.html` file shows the code producing this issue.  The `bugSolution.html` demonstrates some mitigation techniques.
